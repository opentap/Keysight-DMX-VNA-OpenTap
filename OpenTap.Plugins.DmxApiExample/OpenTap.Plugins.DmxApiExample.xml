            This test step is required as the first step in any test plan using the DmxApiExample TAP plugin.  When run, this
            step establishes an IO connection between the client PC (running the TAP sequence) and the VNA.  It requires that
            the user has already added a valid VNA instrument to the TAP bench settings.  All steps following the connection step
            will use the selected VNA.  A new connection step can be called in the same sequence to redirect subsequent step to a
            different VNA.  However, steps targeting different VNAs cannot be interspersed and have to be organized in sequential
            blocks preceded each with a connection step.

            This static class is designed to hold an instance of a DmxApi object so that it can be
            shared among all the steps in a TAP session.
            The DmxInstance is initialized in the ConnectionStep.  In the ConnectionStep, a new instance
            of the DmxApi object is created and a call is made to the DmxApi.ConnectToVna, using the
            address and the timeout assigned to the VnaInstrument assigned to the ConnectionStep.
            All subsequent steps in the session will use the same instance of the DmxApi and the connected
            VNA until another ConnectionStep is executed.
